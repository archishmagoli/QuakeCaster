# Earthquake Simulator Project
## Setup
- Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Install Python and, if necessary, the `tkinter` library (instructions found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-in-windows/)).
(I may have missed some steps - feel free to add steps as needed).
