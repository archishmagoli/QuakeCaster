# QuakeCaster Earthquake Simulator Project
## Background + About the Lab Experiment
(Under construction)

## User Setup
- Clone this repository and run `bipolarDataSender.exe` to start the GUI. From there, you have the required information to complete the lab.

## Developer Setup
- Install the following software: 
  - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
  - Python (version `3.10.*` or above)
  - `tkinter` library (instructions [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-in-windows/)): required for GUI creation.
  - `matplotlib` library: required for data visualization.
  - `pandas` library: required for data visualization. 
    - (Both `pandas` and `matplotlib` can be installed through `pip` on the command line.)

## Features (Continuously Updated)
- Ability to customize motor speed and direction of rotation.
- Live updation of force vs. time graph, based on values sent from the Vernier force sensor.
- (In development) Data export to CSV/Excel formats.
